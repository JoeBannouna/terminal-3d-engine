### Compiling & Running
Runs on Linux only
```
make engine
```

### Main entry point file
```
engine.c
```

### Key points
- Extendable to support more polygons in `geometry.h`
- Handles all linear-algebra-related logic in `vector.c`
- Rendering logic and engine state is in `engine.c`

This project is for fun/testing purposes.
